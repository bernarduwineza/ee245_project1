# EE245 Project Phase 1
#### Phase 1  of the project for EE245 (Advanced Robotics) at University of California, Riverside. Spring 2019. 


#### How to Run the Code 

One needs to run the main file. The main.py file is located in /e245_project1/phase1/
This will prompt the user for the input and plot all the necessary plots.
##### Dependencies 
This code has been tested using Python 3.6. There is no guarantee that it would work as intended on other versions. 
It is assumed that matplotlib, scipy, and numpy have already been installed with the Python interpreter.
